Noll Canceling Movement Script for AutoHotkey v1

This script ensures smooth and precise movement in games by preventing simultaneous key presses from conflicting. It automatically releases one strafe key when another is pressed, allowing only one key per axis (horizontal: A/D, vertical: W/S) to be active at a time.

This setup prevents issues where holding both strafe keys can cause unresponsive movement. Ideal for achieving perfect strafing patterns. Press Esc to exit.
