Noll Canceling Movement Script for AutoHotkey v1

This script optimizes in-game movement by preventing simultaneous key presses from conflicting. It ensures that only one directional key per axis (horizontal: A/D, vertical: W/S) is active at a time, automatically releasing the opposing key when another is pressed. This feature eliminates unresponsive movement, providing a smoother and more controlled experience.

Key Features:

Prevents conflicting key presses on the same axis
Enhances precision and responsiveness in movement
Simple operation with F5 to exit
